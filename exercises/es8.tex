\begin{exercise}{
    Let $C$ and $A$ be complete lattices, $(\alpha, C, A, \gamma)$ be a Galois insertion, $f: C \to C$ be an additive concrete operation (i.e. for all $S \subseteq C$, $f(\vee_C S) = \vee_C f(S)$). Prove that: there exists a monotone abstract operation $f^\sharp: A \to A$ such that $\alpha \circ f = f^\sharp \circ \alpha$ holds if and only if for all $a \in A$ there exists some $a' \in A$ such that $\vee_C \left\{ c \in C \mid f(c) \leq \gamma(a) \right\} = \gamma(a')$
